DESCRIPTION ABOUT DIGITAL FILTER DESIGN

Digital filter design involves creating systems that process discrete-time signals to modify their frequency content or time-domain characteristics. These filters are crucial in various fields like signal processing, image processing, and communications, enabling noise reduction, signal enhancement, and data analysis. Digital filters are implemented in software, offering flexibility and precision unlike their analog counterparts.

Filter design is the process of designing a signal processing filter that satisfies a set of requirements, some of which may be conflicting. The purpose is to find a realization of the filter that meets each of the requirements to an acceptable degree SOME ADVANTAGES One of the main advantages of digital filters is their flexibility and accuracy. Unlike analog filters, which have fixed characteristics and are prone to component variations, temperature changes, and aging effects, digital filters can be easily designed, modified, and optimized using software tools OUTPUT
